            Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer with 3+ years of experience. I have
            worked with clients across the globe to create high performance &
            rich interactive websites that work across all platforms & devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm very familiar with technologies like React, Node.JS, Firebase,
            etc. I can also build hand-coded websites using HTML5, CSS3, &
            JavaScript. With a strong emphasis on "Performance and
            Responsiveness", I look for creative ways to push the boundaries.
          </p>
          <p>Here are the list of technologies I have worked with:</p>
          <ul className="skills-list">
            <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
